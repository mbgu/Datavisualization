# Datavisualization
data visualization with python

This repository is related to data visualization and provides a simple visualization of the retrieved data. 

The code is written in Python.

This repository focuses on data visualization. 

It utilizes Python and several libraries to work with the data, including Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn.

The code performs the following steps:

Import necessary libraries.
Reads a CSV file ("hcvr.csv") containing data.
Describes the data using data.describe() and provides information about it with data.info().
Displays the first 10 and last 10 samples of the dataset.
Separates the features (X) and target values (y).
Normalizes the features using Scikit-Learn's normalize function.
Finally, it displays the last 10 samples of the dataset again.
The primary goal of this code is to load, explore, and preprocess the data, which is a common initial step in any data analysis or machine learning project.
